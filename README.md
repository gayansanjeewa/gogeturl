GoGetURL is a web application built with Go and Gin for analyzing HTML web pages. The app takes a URL input from the user, fetches the page content, and performs a detailed analysis including HTML version detection, title extraction, link categorization, header counting, and login form detection.

- Extracts the page title
- Counts all headings (h1-h6) with a detailed breakdown
- Identifies and categorizes internal, external, and broken links
- Detects the presence of login forms based on input fields
- Provides clear error messages if the URL is unreachable or invalid
- Includes unit and integration tests
- Leaner Git commit history with reference to the related PR 
- Hot-reloading with Air for development
- TODO: Dockerized for easy deployment

## Technologies Used

- Go (Golang)
- Gin web framework
- HTML tokenizer (`golang.org/x/net/html`)
- `slog` for structured logging
- `air` for live reload
- `stretchr/testify` for test assertions
- Standard Go testing
